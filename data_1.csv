1,0,The gnome and orca interface - was: About Ubuntu,Hi I d to this thread but t the message so it never got out on the list so here s another go Well I can t comment on the accessibility question to run before you can walk is likely to prove unsuccessful You should start with being able to navigate around the property and Most activity the tab key and the are down by pressing the alt key with another For example f for the file menu e for the edit menu very for the view menu By tapping the alt key and the right curser key you establish what the top menu bar You can pull these down to explore what is in each of these I think it is the Window manager that the keyboard access to Gnome which I think is meta city Anyway when is loaded you will be able to tab between buttons of s panel You can press alt to request an application by entering it s name in the run box Or it is likely you can select it by through by alt and then down arrow when you hear a category you wish to explore you step to the right and to withdraw to the left To get to a full console you need to press alt and the appropriate function key i e alt to get to To kill the x Gnome session alt backspace but the live will reload a new session ideal when you get in a mess You can shutdown from the alt menu but I usually go to a ordinary console and issue the fingered salute Go on you can t loose with a live There s nothing to it tab oh and not forgetting the enter key to select That s a short introduction but you would really benefit by reading and yourself See live gnome as a starting point Gena Another GNU user Mobile list ca speech ca mailman,closed loop

its own and backing store Once you do this the allocator becomes a simple slot allocator and most of the really ugly code goes away Do you mean one header file that everything and a bunch of for each connected client and share that get separately I m assuming the ugly code you re to is the bit where it to keep growing the file whenever new join The second thing that you need os some way of gathering the that is not that horrible module That s in the pipeline What i m is to just add a bit of extra magic to the Samba that allow us to split it out per client and per share along with the recording of global and times I m pretty sure this is going to be fairly elegant and small if i get it right I have a separate patch which i can t submit yet it s copyright that out all of the current statistics into smaller that we can turn on and off independently This will allow us more granular control over what to profile and will hopefully avoid nasty performance when we re only interested in isolated of the code Once you have a stable export mechanism then the can simply be one of the of the metrics There s not real need for it to be in the Samba tree I d be with making the client header

should be removed from the tree i can just have a closed source that independently assuming On the other hand since it s in the tree anyway it could be as part of Samba in which case i think the attached two move then add would be the right thing to do These move the into the main build they re just a subset of your branch I was going to samba technical but got lazy Feel free to forward this

1,0,Re: modifying classes after they're instantiated,From Date Wed Storm wrote On Bob wrote Surely you are not suggesting that any random should require a new class Did you mean or whatever I did mean that but only if the class already been can add an additional for example so it can modify behavior If a Lisp implementation ever worked this way it would be considered buggy It would also make Lisp code harder than necessary as it is normal to start development of a class by it a few calling them more making more and so on all within the same session Lisp expect that newly defined will work immediately for old of those classes Come to think of it I also do the same sort of thing in At some time during the execution of my program I load a file that to another class defined elsewhere though the class may not actually have at that point It s not terribly clean in true but it can t be that rare But now that I brought up Lisp I should clarify my position I m still not sure how I would go about compliant Lisp for Parrot As a result I have stayed mostly silent on because a I don t know what I want yet and b I assume I will have to do a lot of anyway so that would allow me to override whatever t work for me In any case Lisp only the first to add method and remove method is a generic function not a class so I don t expect to need anyway So I mention Lisp behavior not because I think Parrot ought to behave that way but as a way of explaining why this me The could stay they would just throw on classes They could but how often are people going to add a bunch of and and then remove them immediately before they ever the class When the class is the bit should be because there are as yet no of the class So then would be useful on the clone True Not all want to clone their classes on modification These would use their own class that don t clone themselves They might not clone their classes from the user perspective but internally it s the only truly safe way to modify a class that already especially when you re talking about remove Otherwise you have that don t exist any longer in the class or that were never in the object The they can come is the option I listed Note that Lisp a form of option where an old instance is to the new class structure at some time before its are next I understand there are ways of making this update relatively cheap without down other method dispatch but I m afraid I m not familiar with them In any case it need not be all that cheap because it s not really in production code If one of their classes is to and by a different their class system will be screwed up inconsistent I m not sure how to deal with explicit would be simpler than it abstracted away This system is much more flexible The normal use case for this class it to me is to redefine an class definition by it one mutate the class of another relatively arcane Are you suggesting that this is a bad idea simply because it can be in this manner Despite being arcane and assuming the operation sense at all I would argue that this scenario still ought to work If the basic Parrot classes support mutation then even an that normally inflexible classes ought to inherit that mutability unless it does something explicit to disable it In which case it ought to disable the clone as well The point about abstraction is a good one It can also be satisfied by the clone method If a class a different way of handling it can return a version of itself instead of a new clone in those where the operation was as a modification of an class Would the code that does the class mutation need to do anything different with the result in the clone no clone case I e in of it further or doing something to finalize the What if the class I imagine they would need to be automatically or not as well Error recovery would also be easier for explicit what if one of the class an error I m afraid you lost me How would this be different Could you provide some more information Essentially what if you call it automatically the class and the automatic for some reason Then you get a mysterious exception about to clone class leaving the average user wondering why it was trying to clone a class in the first place Here s another example Suppose you change a class definition in such a way that several are and a few more are added If that like an single operation at the level even though it a slew of Parrot then you want to be sure that the class manipulation completely before the original class definition as the one that should return Bob documentation Body,closed loop

were checked by the security guard a malfunction and the alarm reset That kind of theft distraction was the calling card of both the Republican Army a band that was noted for art dating back or its rival loyalist group the Ulster Volunteer Force which was starting to follow suit What was the doing in one might ask Was this really might be the best answer Boston like so many US is filled with ethnic that are deeply rooted in the culture and politics of the old country Boston is so even some of the speak with a brogue The city long with and either out recruiting or raising money for the cause Boston s notorious Winter Hill mob headed by the s Top Ten Most fugitive Bulger at times more power than the traditional that supposedly the city from its headquarters in Providence Island had strong along with law enforcement inside the Boston police department and unfortunately Boston s office The deadly mob boss who t go on the lam until could have easily given his a pair of authentic Boston police or even for a duo of legitimate on his payroll to pull off the Nine Martin The General a mobster with loose to the hit the famous Sir collection at House in This was the same palatial century mansion museum by the a decade before s gang used a to make a hole in a large window the deliberately set off the alarm it in some manner so it t go off again then outside in the grass as the police and security checked it out Once the coast was clear they returned and worth a and the usual and along with the same exact Madame that the had The matching in each case was the alarm within an hour of the entry In the however there was no indication of how an accomplice could have the building clandestinely and to the fourth floor undetected prior to the official entry at the main security station later There was however an employee who a polygraph quit his job and t bother to return for his last pay cheque The person any participation in the robbery and no connection beyond his highly suspicious behaviour was ever established St s Day in the area seeing a medium sized light vehicle near the museum from to Two men were inside that fitted the description of the The first was about medium build with a shiny fake short dark hair and square gold framed glasses The second man was taller and about with puffy collar length black hair and the same type of fake They were not however as wearing police at least not then my on site inspection of the castle like museum I anew why the grand Titian t taken and why the and finial were It again like part theft of the century and part fraternity prank Looking closer I a small dent in the wall above the now finial less flag The had the eagle against the wall in the process of yanking it off possibly it That was telling Not only were they determined to take the curious item they apparently had a hard time doing so From a psychological perspective I the possibility that the were real They had with the confidence and gumption of men who had worn the badge and blue uniform before and knew the respect the A notation buried in a file that the pair each wore standard black police on their live that crackled with authentic police activity the array of use to designate particular The additionally like men who knew their way about a crime scene investigation lab The went over the place with a fine toothed comb and came up with nothing not a fingerprint footprint hair sample clothing nothing The duct tape was the kind that can be anywhere on the planet with no tracing The surprisingly enough were nearly as prevalent available everywhere from security supply to S M sex The completely off the radar a neat trick considering that the security said they t wearing If the had the lab because they were indeed real Boston Blues who knew the score what a hornet s nest this was going to be Either way the disguise was an extremely effective ruse THE SPECULATION CIRCLED back around to Bulger and or s notorious General Was in town That was easy enough to check and dismiss unless he was under an alias which he t known to do In fact like most he was mostly provincial and territorial Plus there was no indication that his previous art had brought him anything but the same grief his quickly discovered no stepping forward to take a chance on anything so well known Whoever was responsible the key to it was the same as always follow the money to the oil The law enforcement strategy was for everybody to pound their That was especially true of me as my were directly connected to the art world The problem was a reward had them all Nobody was going to give up their lottery ticket by they t know anything Most t even wait until we on the phone and us that they might know something All they they kept one con man after the other was a little up front flash money to get the ball rolling The were up a storm as fierce as the one in s missing sea painting Needing a new identity to deal with them I super art dealer international man of money and action I put out the word far and wide that I was in the market for Degas and baby I d even be interested in paying top dollar for a or a finial once waved by a general with a severe short guy s complex That is if anybody out there just to have any of those While waiting for the to filter in I hit the and read everything I could about New art Some of the I knew well like the Museum coin from past I also took refresher in the of Degas and in case I had to start the rash of that often after a sensational theft I noted with interest that was a tavern owner with lots of two that probably were instrumental in keeping his production so low Of all the that flooded in only three or four were worth One pointed to a noted Boston fence who was spreading the word that he had a bead on the art and could broker the deal I him as shady art dealer and as he tried to work me for a finder s fee up front Since he had some credibility with the Boston we agreed to have a sit down at a ritzy Pier restaurant my treat When the time came he never We wrote it off as another hustle The unusual no show was the beginning of a disturbing trend One of the local had some solid with the and nothing came through with them either Another Boston agent was in tight with Bulger who was actually a long time informant dating back to when he was a street punk That extremely rare inside connection nonetheless to produce any information I was starting to get a really bad feeling about what was going on on both sides of the law With such a wealth of a top mob boss how come nobody knew anything about such a major theft Where was the traditional mob blessing to operate in someone s territory THAT QUESTION T be until a decade later In a federal investigation headed by Judge Mark Wolf accused Boston and of handling in an illegal manner That set off one of the worst in bureau history Special Agent the man to Bulger was subsequently in of one count of racketeering two of obstruction of justice and one count of making a false statement to the He was found innocent of the even of information that led to the of three Today s verdict for what he a Winter Hill Gang operative as a law enforcement agent said US Attorney J was to in prison s supervisor Morris to and to information to about police He was immunity for against Suffice it to say the informant coming into the Boston field office regarding the theft were no doubt being finely screened It may also explain why a legitimate source may not have even calling and why my fence stood me up It s only natural to assume that one of the main of a police officer or a special agent on the mob s payroll is to tip them off regarding the of undercover On the positive side the lead investigator who caught the case and worked it for more than a decade J was a squeaky clean of whose father Frank was a well San homicide detective was completely out of the loop of the older and his group of long time and was never suspected of any foul play It t a task it was a passion and it still is told a reporter in the late You get involved in something like this it s part of your life It s part of you AS TIME the lid on what at the Museum closed than a s wallet The fanciful We were told by someone with an complex that the theft was done on behalf of a tycoon who the art as a gift for his new high society That lead went nowhere Another
