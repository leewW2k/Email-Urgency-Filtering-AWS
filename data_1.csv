Launch of the shuttle on a hail flight to the l space station is slipping to no than June said today to give more time to repair foam insulation on the ship s external fuel tank The decision was made after the progress of to date and e testing and analysis to evaluate how those will stand up t o the thermal and aerodynamic of launch While agency were forced to give up any hope of before the May end of the t launch window the assessment it made more sense to stick with the current tank and launch in early June than it did to switch to a new tank If we continue at this pace of repair we should

wrote The metrics export mechanism from in the main samba tree Agreed The first thing you need to do to get this in is to split it into multiple That is each different metrics structure should have its own and backing store Once you do this the allocator becomes a simple slot allocator and most of the really ugly code goes away Do you mean one header file that everything and a bunch of for each connected client and share that get separately I m assuming the ugly code you re to is the bit where it to keep growing the file whenever new join The second thing that you need os some way of gathering the that is not that horrible module That s in the pipeline What i m is to just add a bit of extra magic to the Samba that allow us to split it out per client and per share along with the recording of global and times I m pretty sure this is going to be fairly elegant and small if i get it right I have a separate patch which i can t submit yet it s copyright that out all of the current statistics into smaller that we can turn on and off independently This will allow us more granular control over what to profile and will hopefully avoid nasty performance when we re only interested in isolated of the code Once you have a stable export mechanism then the can simply be one of the of the metrics There s not real need for it to be in the Samba tree I d be with making the client header file and library I guess my real problem with this is that there s already a in the in Samba This is broken right now it won t compile because some have been around If it s not going to be then it should be removed from the tree i can just have a closed source that independently assuming On the other hand since it s in the tree anyway it could be as part of Samba in which case i think the

0,0,Re: modifying classes after they're instantiated,From Date Wed Storm wrote On Bob wrote Surely you are not suggesting that any random should require a new class Did you mean or whatever I did mean that but only if the class already been can add an additional for example so it can modify behavior If a Lisp implementation ever worked this way it would be considered buggy It would also make Lisp code harder than necessary as it is normal to start development of a class by it a few calling them more making more and so on all within the same session Lisp expect that newly defined will work immediately for old of those classes Come to think of it I also do the same sort of thing in At some time during the execution of my program I load a file that to another class defined elsewhere though the class may not actually have at that point It s not terribly clean in true but it can t be that rare But now that I brought up Lisp I should clarify my position I m still not sure how I would go about compliant Lisp for Parrot As a result I have stayed mostly silent on because a I don t know what I want yet and b I assume I will have to do a lot of anyway so that would allow me to override whatever t work for me In any case Lisp only the first to add method and remove method is a generic function not a class so I don t expect to need anyway So I mention Lisp behavior not because I think Parrot ought to behave that way but as a way of explaining why this me The could stay they would just throw on classes They could but how often are people going to add a bunch of and and then remove them immediately before they ever the class When the class is the bit should be because there are as yet no of the class So then would be useful on the clone True Not all want to clone their classes on modification These would use their own class that don t clone themselves They might not clone their classes from the user perspective but internally it s the only truly safe way to modify a class that already especially when you re talking about remove Otherwise you have that don t exist any longer in the class or that were never in the object The they can come is the option I listed Note that Lisp a form of option where an old instance is to the new class structure at some time before its are next I understand there are ways of making this update relatively cheap without down other method dispatch but I m afraid I m not familiar with them In any case it need not be all that cheap because it s not really in production code If one of their classes is to and by a different their class system will be screwed up inconsistent I m not sure how to deal with explicit would be simpler than it abstracted away This system is much more flexible The normal use case for this class it to me is to redefine an class definition by it one mutate the class of another relatively arcane Are you suggesting that this is a bad idea simply because it can be in this manner Despite being arcane and assuming the operation sense at all I would argue that this scenario still ought to work If the basic Parrot classes support mutation then even an that normally inflexible classes ought to inherit that mutability unless it does something explicit to disable it In which case it ought to disable the clone as well The point about abstraction is a good one It can also be satisfied by the clone method If a class a different way of handling it can return a version of itself instead of a new clone in those where the operation was as a modification of an class Would the code that does the class mutation need to do anything different with the result in the clone no clone case I e in of it further or doing something to finalize the What if the class I imagine they would need to be automatically or not as well Error recovery would also be easier for explicit what if one of the class an error I m afraid you lost me How would this be different Could you provide some more information Essentially what if you call it automatically the class and the automatic for some reason Then you get a mysterious exception about to clone class leaving the average user wondering why it was trying to clone a class in the first place Here s another example Suppose you change a class definition in such a way that several are and a few more are added If that like an single operation at the level even though it a slew of Parrot then you want to be sure that the class manipulation completely before the original class definition as the one that should return Bob documentation Body

cause Boston s notorious Winter Hill mob headed by the s Top Ten Most fugitive Bulger at times more power than the traditional that supposedly the city from its headquarters in Providence Island had strong along with law enforcement inside the Boston police department and unfortunately Boston s office The deadly mob boss who t go on the lam until could have easily given his a pair of authentic

hour of the entry In the however there was no indication of how an accomplice could have the building clandestinely and to the fourth floor undetected prior to the official entry at the main security station later There was however an employee who a polygraph quit his job and t bother to return for his last pay cheque The person any participation in the robbery and no connection beyond his highly suspicious behaviour was ever established St s Day in the area seeing a medium sized light vehicle near the museum from to Two men were inside that fitted the description of the The first was about

available everywhere from security supply to S M sex The completely off the radar a neat trick considering that the security said they t wearing If the had the lab because they were indeed real Boston Blues who knew the score what a hornet s nest this was going to be Either way the disguise was an extremely effective ruse THE SPECULATION CIRCLED back around to Bulger and or s notorious General Was in town That was easy enough to check and dismiss unless he was under an alias which he t known to do In fact like most he was mostly provincial and territorial Plus there was no indication that his previous art had brought him anything but the same grief his quickly discovered no stepping forward to take a chance on anything so well known Whoever was responsible the key to it was the same as always follow the money to the oil The law enforcement strategy was for everybody to pound their That was especially true of me as my were directly connected to the art world The problem was a reward had them all Nobody was going to give up their lottery ticket by they t know anything Most t even wait until we on the phone and us that they might know something All they they kept one con man after the other was a little up front flash money to get the ball rolling The were up a storm as fierce as the one in s missing sea painting Needing a new identity to deal with them I super art dealer

with a severe short guy s complex That is if anybody out there just to have any of those While waiting for the to filter in I hit the and read everything I could about New art Some of the I knew well like the Museum coin from past I also took refresher in the of Degas and in case I had to start the rash of that often after a sensational theft I noted with interest that was a tavern owner with lots of two that probably were instrumental in keeping his production so low Of all the that flooded in only three or four were worth One pointed to a noted Boston fence who was spreading the word that he had a bead on the art and could broker the deal I him as shady art dealer and as he tried to work me for a finder s fee up front Since he had some credibility with the Boston we agreed to have a sit down at a ritzy Pier restaurant my treat When the time came he never We wrote it off as another hustle The unusual no show was the beginning of a disturbing trend One of the local had some solid with the and nothing came through with them either Another Boston agent was in tight with Bulger who was actually a long time informant dating back to when he was a street punk That extremely rare inside connection nonetheless to produce any information I was starting to get a really bad feeling about what was going on on both sides of the law With such a wealth of a top mob boss how come nobody knew anything about such a major theft Where was the traditional mob blessing to operate in someone s territory THAT QUESTION T be until a decade later In a federal investigation headed by Judge Mark Wolf accused Boston and of handling in an illegal manner That set off one of the worst in bureau history Special Agent the man to Bulger was subsequently in of one count of racketeering two of obstruction of justice and one count of making a false statement to the He was found innocent of the even of information that led to the of three Today s verdict for what he a Winter Hill Gang operative as a law enforcement agent said US Attorney J was to in prison s supervisor Morris to and to information to about police He was immunity for against Suffice it to say the informant coming into the Boston field office regarding the theft were no doubt being finely screened It may also explain why a legitimate source may not have even calling and why my fence stood me up It s only natural to assume that one of the main of a police officer or a special agent on the mob s payroll is to tip them off regarding the of undercover On the positive side the lead investigator who caught the case and worked it for more than a decade J was a squeaky clean of whose father Frank was a well San homicide detective was completely out of the loop of the older and his group of long time and was never suspected of any foul play It t a task it was a passion and it still is told a reporter in the late You get involved in something like this it s part of your life It s part of you AS TIME the lid on what at the Museum

wild goose chase took me to Canada I was to to meet with this Little character with a accent an G looking who see to have an in see with the who have the goods see Little set up a meeting with the see

was garbage said he d only tell me about the theft after we did the Morse code deal Right And we d do The Da Code deal after that After a few of this run around I again sensed that something was
