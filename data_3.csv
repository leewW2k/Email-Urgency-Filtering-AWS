0,0,"Cabot Wealth Advisory 4/14/07  -  Easy To Begin, Impossible To Finish",Logic China Entrepreneurship Style Making Money from World of Warcraft It s time for a little more coverage of China Why Because that s where the action is Those stocks just won t quit And neither will my brain which is still weighing the and I experienced on my recent trip there with other and occasionally coming up with surprising For example My daughter who is now in China as a college junior spent her freshman year at the University of Among the first of business once she in was a mobile phone and to do this she to have a local bank account So she into a bank one day and to open an account The response Come back tomorrow we re too busy To me it was a perfect illustration of the attitude that the job of the worker is more important than the needs of the customer I don t believe this could happen in though as time goes on I know it becomes more possible But I know with absolute certainty that it t happen in China A few back in fact I wrote about the issue of Excess Human Capital in China a reality that a willing worker often two or three for any task that needs to be done More recently my daughter wrote in a similar vein and I think you find her interesting The people are the most overwhelmingly enthusiastic I ever seen Their eagerness to seize every opportunity to sell is obvious Besides fruit street have everything from to beer from nail to hot sweet potatoes from bicycle seat to new soles for your And that s just in the back alley behind my school Their determination to sell you stuff into huge for the customer Not only does it mean low great variety and convenience the service is also incomparable I went to buy a with my friend on and it was unlike any experience you d have in the We out browsing on the ground floor of one of the electronics in where the salespeople swarming the floor shout compliment and sometimes even grab to get your attention on their product Once we d expressed interest they all kept trying to convince us to come to their on the upper explaining that the ground floor was in ten It turned out to be true and found a couple she so we three of the salespeople to escort us to the floor which they did in extremely courteous fashion Their store on the floor was with helpful salespeople and large blue We sat on a couch and they gave us paper of water then brought over several and set them on the coffee table in front of us to try out The manager of the store who spoke sat down on the couch across from us and the of each computer and told us the which he could lower a bit just for us of course After chose a small light and an inexpensive brand one of the salespeople Office and an internal wireless card for her right there at the table Then he gave her a free computer bag to carry it away in and we were out of the building by another salesperson a girl who was very by our pale skin s curly red hair and my height who carried the computer out for us The overall feeling is that you re doing them a favor by the computer from them which given that there are at least four in filled with people selling you kind of are The of this entrepreneurial spirit are complicated and I won t pretend to be an expert yet But I think a lot of it comes from the newness of this type of opportunity as recently as the there was no private property in China all were state We re only at the mid in my history class right now but I have studied the economic some in Sociology and some in in which our current lesson is Self Employed Cucumber Seller and Money Chasing not Although tight control was and is the private business and private property and gave the people a whole new range of The word for entering the private sector we just learned in our cucumber seller lesson literally into into the sea It s a big deal in a country where state composed the entirety of the economy less than a lifetime ago The money chasing part of the lesson who will sacrifice everything to earn money ethical business The point is even by the of non communist the in China is huge thriving flexible and growing And of course it s not all because of the entrepreneurial spirit there s the population the effects of raising the standard of living the growing middle class and probably some cultural too What it for me is I can buy everything I need within a minute walk from my dorm and it s cheap too Note This intelligent young woman of course I m who s in journalism and international is available for summer employment in the Boston area Back in which in clipper ship days s China trade my current view of China is centered on the of the stocks that climb up my computer monitor And I got to tell you they re strong I thought we d have some kind of pause in the market particularly after Cabot China Report was ranked the advisory letter in the business based on its return last year After you re there s no place to go but down But I was wrong While we had a quick plunge in the Shanghai Index a few ago just enough to shake out the weak stocks have back and are new again How to explain it Fast growth and the world s money to pour into China At the most basic level demand supply there simply t enough stocks to go around Editor works hard to keep an eye on every one of them and he me there are about stocks that trade in the form of on When I look at the list I see a lot of strong stocks but I also see something else some very big For example there is no major retailer Where we have from Gap to Target to they have none There is no national restaurant chain Where we have s and they have none There are no national food We have Dean Kraft Con and They have none And medical Forget it No hospital No living No stocks Just a few

wrote it up as Stock of the Month in early March and what I wrote then still today Here it is Let s get one thing clear here We re not talking about gambling we re talking about About in the original sense But this t stuff The game industry grown up and of from all over the world The most exciting action right now is taking place in China for that are not hard to understand is growing about per year But of billion people only million have access and just three quarters of those have connection a necessity for most of today s modern So there s a vast untapped market But the industry is growing fast last year the number of to million and their spending on these a whopping to million Limited is our favorite of the top tier game in China mainly because it s the growing The name admittedly awkward to the claim that game is the ninth art after the traditional eight namely painting sculpture architecture literature music dance drama and But the real name to remember here is World of Warcraft because that s the game that for of s World of Warcraft hereafter know as WoW was by an company Blizzard Entertainment in and currently more than million Two million of these are in North million are in and million are in China And every one of those is a customer of which the exclusive license What s so great about this game In a phrase the fact that it s easy to begin but impossible to finish Despite the title it s more than a war game It s more of a quest game in which you via your character strive to complete In the early these are easy to complete alone But as you gain in experience and the become more complex with other in real time becomes necessary So are built up Experience Assets gold clothing accumulate are used and are again or are bought and sold from other just as in the real world And the amazing thing is that the vast majority of these other who are in real time on screen have never met in real life The shorthand for like this is for massively role game But on the screen they form a society and it s a big one In China the maximum number of at one time in the fourth quarter was while the average number of at any time is And it s beautiful society visually in an epic way There are and and Good and bad And the virtual world is ever On for example went off at midnight On it again to celebrate the lunar festival New Year And sometimes you got to buy more to keep up Back on for example the Dark Portal in Blasted and out But this content was only available to of the Burning Crusade expansion pack In the U S you can buy WoW on for and the expansion pack for In China are lower But the real money is in the monthly In the U S it about fifty per day to play the game in China it s about six per day And that s gravy for In the fourth quarter grew from the year before to million while earnings to per share Equally important profit swelled to a fat So what s in the future More WoW of course The end of this game s life is nowhere in sight Nevertheless the company is out a slew of new that will broaden its revenue stream These include Guild and Soul of The Ultimate Nation which have been in house and three that have been licensed from their and Chronicle two cartoon style and a highly rated first person shooter game Looking further down the road there s the inevitable of the gaming Today you see all gaming in China is done on gaming like the and are not But when they are say already with you can bet will be there to serve the market The stock broke out to new price and just last month and ran up to before back into a consolidation phase As we write it s back to below to kiss its day moving average and we think this a decent entry point Today that buy pretty good the stock back to and found decent support there in part because of a report that U S giant Electronic would pay million for a stake in Electronics this but it s no secret the are working closely on getting Electronic distributed the market And the action of the stock that belief I think aggressive can buy a little now or on any pullback toward Editor s note To receive regular on advice on when to sell consider a no risk trial subscription to

not complicate further by trying to write a and copyright license I would rather avoid those two of law I m not sure that is possible When we re talking about the it is both by copyright and by I can t copy and distribute the unless I am licensed under both What I am is just under both but with two separate of a copyright license and a license the one we are trying to write As long as I need both of them to do what I want to that is to say as long as what I want to do both copyright and I have to comply with both of As soon as I need only one of them I can ignore the written in the other one That s why I think that the same no confusion condition in both is useless and potentially harmful Correct me if I m wrong You could of course separately license the two But then you run in exactly the problem I tried to solve with the conditional copyright grant Which problem I don t understand why I cannot separately license and As an example I write an essay that the and Assume this essay is my original work of authorship I am therefore its copyright holder I license its copyright under the of the GNU Nonetheless those four which are not copyrightable are of their respective and I cannot use them in ways that break unless I have a license that me to do otherwise This is true independently of the copyright license I chose for the essay I don t need to insert into the copyright license as they hold anyway I don t see any problem or contradiction in this What me most is making the copyright grant of permission conditional on the no confusion condition I did that to ensure that people t take the change a few and then use the derivative in a way They would need a copyright license to create a derivative work and they have one but they also would need a license to use a confusingly similar to refer to something other than and they do not have one because the license we are writing does not allow this kind of use Hence I cannot see why the restriction should in your opinion be in the copyright license If the copyright license t tie in to the license but instead do whatever you want with your derivative people could argue the copyright license the restriction In my above example does my of the essay allow people to argue that they can change the text in such a way that it the term to refer to Sun As far as copyright is concerned they need my permission and they indeed have it As far as is concerned they need a permission from Corporation and they do not have one I still fail to see how a copyright license could trump a restriction unless they are Bill or a few Suppose I derive a new image from the swirl and assume that my derivative work is sufficiently different that it s not confusingly similar to the original It is my understanding that I would not need any license to use my heavily image not even for commercial use Is this correct I would instead need a copyright license to create and distribute my derivative work If the derivative image t confusingly similar to the then the no confusion condition does not apply That s why I say it should not stay attached to the heavily image It should be as soon as the license is no longer That me to place the no confusion condition inside the license but not inside the copyright license You are not to use any sign in commerce that confusion with someone s It t matter if your sign is a derivative work of the under copyright law I could be completely ignorant of your mark fiddle a bit with the Gimp and produce a swirl that accidentally like the Copyright I m fine but I still can t put that swirl on with an operating system and sell those What you are saying here perfectly sense to me but to confirm that there s no need to insert the no condition into the copyright license So I can t imagine a situation where the restriction affecting the copyright license would be a problem I can t imagine a situation where it would be useful It could be awkward and misleading For instance suppose you an image a fish which to be a derivative work of the swirl after many many heavy That image is not confusingly similar to the Hence the only license is the copyright one You would receive the fish image with a copyright license and no license Suppose the copyright license stated that you cannot use the fish image in commerce in such a way to cause confusion as to the affiliation and so forth with the Project and t it be awkward I mean it s true but the same for any other entity You cannot use the fish image in commerce to cause confusion as to the affiliation and so forth with Corporation either But there s no need to state that inside the copyright license say so Please note that with the fish image there s more or less the same likelihood of causing confusion with the Project and with Corporation actually close to zero In summary I think that like through copyright would be possibly harmful This t a restriction it is an actual restriction You re right that that it through copyright is less harmful possibly harmless but useless as well An alternative would be to drop the exception on the copyright license and modify the license to say The Mark Holder hereby you to use the or a version thereof in any way You are not authorized to use the or a version thereof That it clear you are not licensed under the to use in a way It s not as clear as what I previously because now you have to figure out which the copyright license that you can do anything or the license that you cannot do this one thing As I said above I think that none of them One as far as are
