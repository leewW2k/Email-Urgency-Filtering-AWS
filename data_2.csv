1,1,[Proposed PATCH] Change libparrot Names and Locations,Content Type text plain ISO format Content Transfer Attached is a patch to change the and for I have tested the for core Parrot on Visual C and Minor static now the path to the library not the library name This up better with the F too Ordered for linking and parrot For some reason s t reorder them Removed reference to F file t exist Now for the real Background One key difference between Visual C and or better and ELF is that the link time library and library are different though I guess this is somewhat comparable to ELF s Visual C two for dynamic linking library for linking import library library during The base name t have to be the same to you can have a F and a F library must be found in the search order usually it s best to put it into the same directory as the executable There s no prefix There s no scheme but if multiple are it s best to include the number in the name For example F Visual C C Library or F Dynamic Link Library Search Order en us library Visual C The static library is now at F the import library at F The is now at F is a mix between and which here too The static library is now at F The import library is at F the at F yes that s a prefix here User s Guide Building and ug net and enterprise Manual gnu linker The static library is F the import library F and the F and enterprise Manual gnu linker make

1,1,Re: modifying classes after they're instantiated,Content Type text plain ISO format Content Transfer Content Disposition On wrote On Bob wrote I like this one but I also have another alternative First make all class modification code return a Whenever one of these is on a class the class is Yeah this one came up on too Two first is the non obviousness of a method like return a version of the class The disadvantage of the interface the advantage of the Second is that the most sensible return value is some form of error if are turned off The method a so will know they should do something with it and as long as it s I don t think it s going to be a problem I also think these require a manual clone is going to be even less obvious Secondly the class can simply return null if there s an error If want more detail they can enable What does return after one of these If it the new class then there is no need for the class to do so except possibly for convenience whatever is currently registered as the class Yes Always true if we were to do automatic Also true in some of explicit as a optional feature of clone You re absolutely right However to play devil s advocate what if the class inside clone for some reason This is the same idea as the class inside which you said was a problem Not all want to clone their classes on modification These would use their own class that don t clone themselves They might not clone their classes from the user perspective but internally it s the only truly safe way to modify a class that already especially when you re talking about remove Otherwise you have that don t exist any longer in the class or that were never in the object The they can come is the option I listed Whether it s safe or not need the option of not their classes Therefore Parrot needs it We can t tell language that we can t support their language because it s not safe Any language whose class affect already would have its own way of removed in or get set that aside if classes every time is truly the only safe way to modify them why does solution leave the up to the user What if they forget or decide not to and then remove a method on the class When that method later it goes boom From that perspective the call to clone inside and the like is the only way to guarantee a sane class system If one of their classes is to and by a different their class system will be screwed up inconsistent I m not sure how to deal with explicit would be simpler than it abstracted away This system is much more flexible The point about abstraction is a good one It can also be satisfied by the clone method If a class a different way of handling it can return a version of itself instead of a new clone in those where the operation was as a modification of an class Here s where we re after nearly the same thing in two different ways A flag for the following clone t return a clone at all a strange interface and an unnecessary complication especially since it only sense for class In fact a version of itself or a clone of itself from class is exactly what the solution I Error recovery would also be easier for explicit what if one of the class an error I m afraid you lost me How would this be different Could you provide some more information Essentially what if you call it automatically the class and the automatic for some reason Then you get a mysterious exception about to clone class leaving the average user wondering why it was trying to clone a class in the first place If clone it to an internal error in the class data so it that would fail anyway Therefore would catch the exception and throw a more descriptive one saying internal error in class data or something like that so that s not exactly a huge step up but at least it why it instead of just what The point is that regardless of whether they involve classes or not have to be able to call other and it s their responsibility to deal with the in a well manner P S The of your message that I t respond to I agreed with On Bob wrote Surely you are not suggesting that any random should require a new class Did you mean or whatever I did mean that but only if the class already been can add an additional for example so it can modify behavior If a Lisp implementation ever worked this way it would be considered buggy It would also make Lisp code harder than necessary as it is normal to start development of a class by it a few calling them more making more and so on all within the same session Lisp expect that newly defined will work immediately for old of those classes You hit the nail on the head The problem is that Parrot can t assume that every language its classes With solution all classes are whether the language they belong to it or not With the solution I would not clone itself on but would When the class is the bit should be because there are as yet no of the class So then would be useful on the clone True To clarify the bit should be on the newly clone not on the original class since does not change the fact that it If that s what you meant sorry just making sure I understand you If one of their classes is to and by a different their class system will be screwed up inconsistent I m not sure how to deal with explicit would be simpler than it abstracted away This system is much more flexible The normal use case for this class it to me is to redefine an class definition by it one mutate the class of another relatively arcane Are you suggesting that this is a bad idea simply because it can be in this manner Yes For example code that with classes through their abstracted interface good design from an standpoint would have no idea which language they came from It t be too common but doing it this way that the interface works even when classes are used in ways we haven t thought of Also I already in my previous a solution to the performance problem inherent in them Despite being arcane and assuming the operation sense at all I would argue that this scenario still ought to work If the basic Parrot classes support mutation then even an that normally inflexible classes ought to inherit that mutability unless it does something explicit to disable it In which case it ought to disable the clone as well Unless the class does something extra like the clone in a I don t see anything wrong with an immutable class since already of the class won t be affected in any way Personally I think doing something extra inside clone would be a bad idea since clone should remain a low level data copy operation an explicit clone this since it clone to deal with high level class system semantics The point about abstraction is a good one It can also be satisfied by the clone method If a class a different way of handling it can return a version of itself instead of a new clone in those where the operation was as a modification of an class Would the code that does the class mutation need to do anything different with the result in the clone no clone case I e in of it further or doing something to finalize the That could be a problem with that solution caller code to clone the class itself what should be a clean interface because now caller code must concern itself with whether the class was or not Error recovery would also be easier for explicit what if one of the class an error I m afraid you lost me How would this be different Could you provide some more information Essentially what if you call it automatically the class and the automatic for some reason Then you get a mysterious exception about to clone class leaving the average user wondering why it was trying to clone a class in the first place Here s another example Suppose you change a class definition in such a way that several are and a few more are added If that like an single operation at the level even though it a slew of Parrot then you want to be sure that the class manipulation completely before the original class definition as the one that should return That s only a problem if and register the class every time they re which in my opinion should not be done Class registration should take place after all are Sorry for the length t help myself Storm

0,0,Cabot Wealth Advisory 4/12/07 - The Clean Energy Bandwagon,By Timothy Logic Major in Perception Take Longer Than My Favorite Solar Power Stock Modern Day Easter The longer I m in the business the more I accumulate Some of these are well known like Cut short and Never fight the tape while are more obscure These usually work because they re shorthand of I learned the hard way Who among us t a losing stock far longer than we should have that the great would eventually be by other And who among us t to buy into a powerful new bull market that fundamental would pull stocks down I have but I don t any more And those well worn are part of the reason The truism that s on my mind today is not so pithy as those above and certainly not as well known but I found it useful when dealing with big Here it is Major of perception take longer than on both the individual and the group level And the reason I m thinking of this truism is global warming So let s start with a question How long do you think it s been since the first evidence of human global warming was noted by Ten Twenty Stop to think a minute Make your best guess and then read on A little research that the first definitive were made in the by Keeling who spent carbon dioxide on Loa in two above sea level The National Science Foundation used his data to warn of the greenhouse effect in And here we are later with more and more people every day climbing on the global warming not least because of Al Gore s movie An Inconvenient Truth But there remain plenty of in two main in my opinion The first group who demand absolute proof which is difficult to provide simply because climate science is so complex The second group those generally who don t trust the usually because they perceive these as an anti business particularly anti big oil agenda Fact is it s hard to change your opinion So while the change in that change to happen slowly both on the individual level and on the group level And as perception is extremely important to us because in perception move stocks But when as big a figure as Newt up with Kerry and for the Republican Party s on the issue saying in part For most of the last the environment been a powerful emotional tool for bigger government and higher And therefore if you re a conservative the minute you start hearing these you know what s coming next which is bigger government and higher So even though it may be the right thing to do you end up fighting it because you don t want big government and higher you know we an important milestone That surprise announcement by a few days the latest release by the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which gave further detail on and other extreme weather saying more of these are to be as a short term result of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere And this by a few the semi annual of the Clean Edge U S Index This index admittedly not widely yet is designed to track the performance of clean energy that are publicly in the U S It engaged in clean energy such as solar and advanced The five major sub that the cover are Renewable Electricity Generation Renewable Energy Storage Conversion Energy Intelligence and Advanced Energy Related out of the index in March for their general failure to thrive were Active Power C D Capstone Turbine Distributed Energy Quantum Fuel and Added to the index for their current strength and high potential were Solar First Solar Solar Solar and US It t take a genius to notice that the word solar in five of those six Fact is these are burning up the track They re growing at triple digit and they still can t make solar fast enough to meet demand So think back to my original truism Major of perception take longer than on both the individual and the group level Project the current shift in public perception forward and imagine a world where more and more attention is on reducing greenhouse Recognize that the year trend of public perception regarding global warming much further to go And then think about becoming an investor in one or more of the that will benefit I suggest you start with First Solar Here s what I wrote in a recent issue of the Cabot Market Letter Possibly the leading glamour stock in the market right now is First Solar a producer of solar and This t just your ordinary solar cell maker there are a handful of them around all growing fast First Solar a different method of its and that s making all the difference Specifically the company a thin film technology which just a fraction of the silicon used in standard solar With silicon in tight demand that First Solar s are much much lower than its In the fourth quarter the company s were per watt produced and with a bunch of long term in place that will generate more than billion of revenue over the next few the company can expand its production capacity knowing the demand will be there That production will help lower further The company a stated goal of being cost competitive with standard electricity by without So far management is exceeding all of its and growth is superb were up and the past two quarters while earnings have into the black to and per share during that time And the stock which in mid after a blowout earnings report fell as the market tumbled but then came roaring back actually new As always you should buy carefully all these stocks are big both up and down and you want to buy smart to improve your of success But there s no the massive growth potential of this group going forward Editor s note To receive regular on First Solar advice on when to sell consider a no risk trial subscription to the Cabot Market Letter our flagship publication Now in its year of publication the Cabot Market Letter all you need to be a successful investor market timing stock selection education and specific buy sell hold advice To get simply click the link below net t While I m at it here are a couple of other on the clean energy One is chip equipment maker Applied which more than one day last week after an analyst said the firm s solar power equipment business could accelerate far faster than most believe No surprise there But what caught my eye was the degree of acceleration While management had that to solar would hit million in the broker they d hit to billion three to four times as high Applied is a huge company and its chart is no better than tepid today but it s good to see those A more interesting play on clean energy is a company whose low cost carbon fiber is in high demand by of the of wind turbines In the fourth quarter s revenue grew to million Equally important are the company to have positive earnings this year for the first time since s chart is strong now Finally there s the biggest supplier of the uranium used in nuclear power been growing every year for the past decade It s been profitable for every one of those too so you know it s well And the stock after spending eleven in a pattern just broken out to new on volume a sign that big are getting back in Special Notice I m to announce the opening of the Cabot Wealth Advisory Forum a place where you can share your about these with other It s free to all my so if you have particular intelligence about one of these or one of these stocks I urge you to contribute it and make us all a little wiser and To get simply click on the link below Finally an Easter story with a long preamble A few ago I wrote a piece about our young To recap four ago my wife and I a year old girl from who spent four at an high school with our daughter and then returned to In the following that visit she on to the University at transferred to the University of in Canada and this year transferred to State College where she s in business administration Now she s both smart and pretty and no doubt will succeed at whatever she now in with her who s also from the same town in And living with us now for two is a new high school girl here for the same one month exchange What all these people seek is a better life As they put it There are no in s college degree in is in accounting But he s making better money here working in the construction business s mother back in is an eye doctor Working for the state a week she per month s mother is a dental assistant working in That s where the money is Someday will offer more opportunity but progress slowly Freed from the control of the Soviet Union just sixteen ago the country the entrepreneurial spirit that the world s faster growing It s still weighed down by a heavy bureaucracy And its government is in turmoil on President deep corruption a bill dissolving Parliament but Parliament declined to dissolve and now the case will head to the Supreme Court Anyway I last week that our family would hide dozen for assorted family and on Easter and so we did But first we spent on afternoon dying every single one It s our tradition and it s a lot of fun especially when you have in the family But knowing the old tradition of dying Easter I was looking forward to to see some superior On that big day however the first other at church and then went off to a full dinner So it t until late in the day that they returned to our house traditional Easter bread and decorated with black red and gold For a split second my were But then I the were on printed shrink wrap just like most buy Disappointed yes not really like everything else are subject to the of change But now I find myself wondering if those shrink wrap were made in China where low wages and a thriving spirit of entrepreneurship make the manufacture of almost anything not just possible but likely In fact in s issue of Cabot Wealth Advisory we take a look at Communism and Capitalism in China from an insider s perspective Yours in pursuit of wisdom and wealth Timothy Publisher Cabot Wealth Advisory Advertisement Cabot Stock of the Month A revolutionary investment advisory that you Wall Street s
