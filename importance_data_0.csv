0,Re: [R] Reasons to Use R,On wrote I m not a programmer but I have the experience that R is good for large especially in combination with statistics This I find a little surprising but maybe it s just a sign that I m not experienced enough with R yet I can t use R for big At all Big take forever to load with read table R frequently out of memory and or never seem to actually converge to By comparison I can point and at this data without problem Of course is running on a pretty powerful machine with a big ram disk so that may be part of the problem R s pass by value semantics also make it harder than it should be to deal with where it s crucial that you not make a copy of the data frame for fear of running out of memory Pass by reference would make data so much easier that I don t really understand how pass by value the standard If there s a trick to doing in place I not found it Right now I m considering starting on a project some big Monte over the complicated posterior parameter of a nonlinear regression model and I have the strong feeling that R will just choke R s great for small but as soon as you even a few hundred of data it to break down If I m doing wrong please tell me is a beast to work with R help math list mailman r help PLEASE do read the posting guide R project posting guide and provide minimal self reproducible code

according to a spokesman snip Original Message Inside US Trade Bush Administration Partial To Congress Date The Bush Administration mid week provided Congress of the text for the newly free trade agreement with but not to a deadline of when it will provide the full text according to congressional The Office of the U S Trade Representative more than half of the text to Congress and industry and agriculture who will have to assess the agreement for a formal report to Congress within a month Assistant U S Trade Representative for Japan and Cutler said on But a critic of the said that the text provided does not cover many of the controversial that were settled in the last round of that ended on Deputy U S Trade Representative said on the U S and are in the process of writing up the agreement after their final marathon session but he that was not unusual There is always additional legal drafting that needs to occur so we be doing that he said Unresolved is the issue of which the should contain with respect to labor and the environment the text now the obligation for each signatory to enforce its own a standard that House have as insufficient and are seeking to strengthen in with the Administration for a new template As a result of these on going there may be a need to revisit the labor and environment said He that was not happy with the fact that there was no final U S government position on the labor and environment If it turns out that there are that would need to be made on labor and environment in order to obtain congressional passage we make a decision jointly as to whether those would be acceptable to he said that is a different case in of labor to other with which the U S because it strong labor and strong taken the position that an can still be over the next days up to the deadline when U S industry have to complete their assessment of the deal according to a spokesman The Bush Administration on formally notified Congress of its intent to sign the just before the expiration of the statutory deadline of midnight and this was possible because Congress agreed to have someone available to formally receive the letter of notification at that time the spokesman said Congress was out of session at that time but the fast track law does not contain a requirement that Congress be in session to receive the formal notification of an Administration s intent to sign a trade agreement according to a Senate aide Therefore the Administration met the statutory of the fast track law he said Separately a spokesman said the deadline for the submission of the notification was determined after with Congress and an internal assessment by U S had initially told their that the deadline was late March in D C The fast track law that a trade agreement can be days after the administration formally to Congress its intent to do so the on it can be before fast track on this year Once a trade agreement is it can be considered under fast track with an up or down vote even after the law itself also said the will pressure other to negotiate with the U S To be honest with you there is a possibility that a successful U S will be the stepping stone to a wave of liberalization in East He also said the with than any other by the U S in such of financial transparency and competition Inside US Trade Cool To Auto In On Date Deputy U S Trade Representative this week out to the auto of the newly U S free trade agreement as by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman D MI and House Ways and Trade Subcommittee Chairman Sander Levin D MI With respect to during the day period to the auto I don t anticipate such said in an press conference He that the automotive took carefully into consideration the expressed by industry and also by of Congress and will enable to access the market Both Levin and in their respective public that the the proposal from of Congress at correcting the automotive trade imbalance between and the U S Instead said the agreement new for and not for the U S industry Both Levin and said they would vote no on the agreement in its current form Separately Sen D MI strongly the and vowed to defeat it at all The automobile industry built the middle class in this country and by supporting this agreement the Administration turned its back on our working she said in an statement Similarly Ford Motor Company and Group as well as the Automotive Trade Policy Council which all three U S on trade expressed disappointment over the outcome of the but stopped short of strong criticism General which in through its partner company to issue a statement Ford Motor Company s Vice President of International Governmental on Congress to reject the in its current form in an statement Group in an statement also to oppose the agreement as we currently understand it The statement pointed out the company every past the U S government However one private sector source that the auto though displeased with the outcome of the might not lobby hard against the given the other major for which they may need administration This fuel an alternative fuel infrastructure and legacy he said This may mean that the will emerge as the only strong force in against the according to this source In its statement the Congress to reject the deal which it said is one sided and of of U S auto this criticism and that the auto industry is better off with this agreement than without it because the for the elimination of tariff and non tariff in the market Without this agreement there is no such assurance he said I would suggest that the industry very much would be better off with the agreement The would phase out the U S tariff for certain immediately and the percent truck tariff over without any specific market access according to U S Some that the U S auto industry is most unhappy with the end of the truck tariff which the congressional automotive proposal sought to exclude from the The percent U S auto tariff will be immediately be for with engine sizes up to said on One private sector source said that this the bulk of the that to the United This would exclude luxury or sports utility he said In addition the would phase out s percent tariff on U S immediately upon entry into force said Under the agreement agreed to its engine displacement tax which the U S had sought to eliminate as a non tariff barrier he said It will revamp its structure in the first three after implementation to require the leveling of the so that of the size the U S e on a level field with somewhere between and percent of the domestic market Assistant for Japan and Cutler said s special consumption tax would be cut to percent from its current percent within three after implementation Cutler said also agreed to reduce the number of of subject to the tax By year three of the she said about percent of and will be in a common category for and above while and below will be in a second category In addition agreed to a bilateral working group that would keep abreast of government on development to prevent future trade said that the group is meant to promote between the U S and on regulatory The bilateral working group a built in transparency requirement to ensure that there is not between the government and industry that we re not aware of with respect to technical said The can bet that any time they share written information with any stakeholder outside of their government concerning a regulation or a technical standard they have to provide that same information to the U S bilateral working group on automotive

0,[Ip-health] Annex 2C Plus provisions in KoreaUS FTA Phrma Chapter,This is a part message in MIME format Picked text plain from alternative More information on the and the version of this article can be found at Annex plus in the US Chapter Associate Director Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property University College of Law Although the final text of the US Free Trade Agreement not been it is evident from a careful reading of s summary that many of its will go far beyond the controversial on s Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme included in Annex of the US Free Trade Agreement Following the practice of that go beyond the minimum requirement of as plus this paper a new phrase Annex plus for in the agreement that go beyond Annex This is a first draft note preliminary analysis I invite to Subsequent will be posted to as new information is Annex and Drug Annex was the first section of an with the U S to attempt to restrict the operation of public pharmaceutical reimbursement based on a drug formulary to by the Republic of as a positive list and by U S as preferred drug The principle of a formulary is simple In order to ensure value for money and negotiate reasonable with drug the payer must be able to say no to some extent to the drug company s of sale This is normally accomplished by that higher priced with equivalent therapeutic value to be subject to some form of prior authorization subject to on use or from reimbursement entirely if the incremental therapeutic value is not considered sufficient to justify the price premium The desire of to have their in the easiest possible manner an incentive for them to negotiate lower to the purchaser can also be used to steer toward generic of or therapeutic for brand name Because of their effectiveness at negotiation of lower some version of a formulary for drug is used by every substantial purchaser of private insurance and U S and foreign and nearly every state government program But the pharmaceutical industry is becoming increasingly successful at on this important and effective tool by public through the operation of binding trade Annex of the U S was the result of intense pharmaceutical industry against one of the most effective drug in the world The scheme works by seeking listing on the formulary to be assessed based on evidence of the comparative effectiveness comparative cost effectiveness against the therapy most likely to be in practice Combined with a reference system the will only list a medicine at higher price than the comparator where it is able to demonstrate an incremental benefit Where a new drug is to offer equivalent to the system will not list the drug at a higher price irrespective of its patent status Annex did not mandate that provide equally simple access to every drug without price restraint as the pharmaceutical industry wished It did however implement a number of and normative that some argue could enable them to challenge listing The Annex included three main Agreed to recognize the value of innovative Transparency provision certain written and independent review process for listing and participation in a Working Group to promote discussion and mutual understanding of the raised in the Annex s Fact Sheet on the US agreement the same general pattern of Annex and therefore one can surmise what much of the language in the final text will be Importantly the Fact Sheet several key in wording and to Annex i e Annex plus that may further decrease the ability of to use its public drug formulary to negotiate lower These are in more detail below Title and Medical Fact Sheet language and Medical A Commitment on Access to Innovative Analysis The first notable Annex plus provision in the US is included in the title of the section Where Annex was titled the fact sheet the section and Medical The inclusion of medical is new Annex only covered reimbursement for not medical The scope of the US is thus likely to be much than Annex C Agreed Fact Sheet language Agreement on common on high quality health care and continued in public health for This provision similar to the included in the US agreement It does not clearly include Annex plus Annex included a set of agreed favorable to the branded drug industry to the important role by innovative pharmaceutical the need to promote access to innovative through transparent expeditious and accountable and the need to recognize the value of innovative Similar on branded can be in the Much may lie in the definition of innovative if that term is used in the agreement The consider an innovative drug as one a clinically important improvement in patient outcome The pharmaceutical industry to equate innovative with do not necessarily have any additional clinical benefit they are by the patent system to be novel not clinically important Annex did not define innovative It will be important to analyze the language for further detail in this area access to innovative Fact Sheet language Commitment to increase access to innovative through insurance the fair reasonable and non discriminatory treatment for pharmaceutical and medical This entire provision to be Annex plus Nothing in Annex a commitment to increase the use of innovative And as nothing in Annex applied to It is not clear what the final text language will do to increase access to innovative The pharmaceutical industry that public should reimburse every product for every registered indication Such a principle would obliterate the effectiveness of a drug formulary since there would be no potential to refuse reimbursement The degree to which the US will damage s power through its formulary is unknown at this point transparency Fact Sheet language on transparency in the and reimbursement process for pharmaceutical and medical Annex included a provision on Transparency applicable only where federal operate or maintain for listing new or for reimbursement For such Annex that the system ensure within a period of time disclose procedural and used to assess a listing afford to to provide provide written for listing and make available an independent review process for the The restriction of the application to federal level reimbursement is noticeably absent from the summary description of the If this absence is carried forward in the actual agreement text it may be the most important Annex plus provision from the point of view of U S At least U S operate preferred drug price for and other Under legislation the U S government the authority to sue to and that do not comply with the U S have raised with the indeterminacy of Annex as applied to Under play a large part in paying for and the drug benefit but ultimately it is federal law that which are covered for reimbursement and thus could be considered a federal program for Annex If the agreement is not expressly limited to federal national level it would more directly threaten the most effective tool that now have in restraining medicine Improper Fact Sheet language Agreement to adopt and maintain to prohibit improper by pharmaceutical and medical device and to enforce such It is not clear what this provision is There is no similar provision in Annex nor was one during the process It is Annex plus although to what effect it is difficult to ascertain and Medical Working Group Fact Sheet language Agreement to establish a and Medical Working Group that will provide for continued dialogue between the United and on health care policy Annex provided for a Working Group to promote discussion and mutual understanding of to this Annex the importance of pharmaceutical research and development to continued health The extension of this mandate to Medical is new and therefore Annex plus Independent Review Body Fact Sheet language Agreement by to establish and maintain an independent body that or regarding the and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and medical Annex provided for an independent review process not a body The distinction could be important with Annex by a review process within the health system with no authority to overturn the decision of the expert body in the It can only report on in dispute back to the expert body which may then decide to reconsider a recommendation but is not obliged to The language creation of an independent body may imply an obligation set up an additional panel of with authority to overturn the decision of the initial panel of that listing This provision would be wasteful and may provide for the pharmaceutical industry to engage in complex and well funded to capture the attention and of the review body through repetitive Interestingly the language in the fact sheet only to Annex both It will therefore be interesting to watch for whether the agreement is in fact one sided when the language is finally Special thanks are to Ruth Fellow in Public Health Care Policy at University School of Public Health who and on an version of this note

with was going to China Normally a routine overseas trip by a government figure is an assistant secretary of state would hardly warrant attention from on Song dynasty ceramics or statuary But in their this time their very were at stake The fear was that who the State Department s bureau of educational and cultural was going to to announce a sweeping ban on the import of art and The the ban in that an insatiable demand for such was the of valuable archaeological in China As it turned out the rumor was false The State Department that is not a June visit although it to say when or how the United will rule on the request But the panic by the gossip in the midst of New York s annual Week last month the high riding on the decision At the center of the controversy is not a official but an obscure State Department advisory panel that become the b te of of everything from to statuary The panel the Cultural Property Advisory Committee been the focus of fierce between who say the art market the of historic and who say that broad import threaten by private and in the United Congress established the committee in to balance the of these pillage abroad while also protecting the legal trade But claim that it now heavily in favor of the archaeological lobby even in when the foreign seeking import have not met the criteria set down by the law I don t think the committee been the intent of the original legislation said Palmer a dealer in century art who worked on cultural patrimony at the State Department in the and establish the Cultural Property Advisory Committee known as C P A C Gibbon a dealer of art in Fe N M and a former member of the committee said some of it now seem to have a full blown prejudice against so much so she in an e mail message that they seek to bend the law to meet a need to end the trade Just how did an entity intended as a grand compromise and by and more than ago come to be seen as the enemy of the commercial art market and argue that the State Department s professional staff the process in recent so that a majority of committee at any given time lean toward broad import counter that unscrupulous are still only too happy to profit from by selling of ambiguous and that import are an important tool for them in At the same time it is clear that recent restitution by like and have and the public to the principle of cultural patrimony the idea that each nation a right to possess and protect its historical The United government currently with to restrict the import of culturally significant To this day it never to grant an initial request for import But current have and up in arms They argue that China s petition is so broad that it would include century ceramics that were mass produced for export And is that an ban on of Classical and material be expanded to include ancient a category of that not been included in other import Palmer that Congress intended the committee to protect only the most significant from pillage not grant broad on the import of entire of a lawyer who and before the committee There is no attempt by C P A C today to differentiate between of great significance and those that are produced in the or multiple of he said But say that the import have been critical in the problem by It proven to be a fairly effective tool for raising awareness of because the U S is such a large art market said an archaeologist at Boston University a curator at the University of Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology said many ancient in and elsewhere now look like a moonscape because of all the illicit digging That is a feature of the existence of a market in she said While the do not stop completely she added they do send a message to the rest of the world that the United the destruction of other cultural property In many say Western have been willing to turn a blind eye to murky if they could get their on uniquely beautiful or rare In recent like the J Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art have agreed to return to their of origin after being with evidence that the had been illegally But and museum reply that they oppose too and that fail to see that an object s aesthetic value and its safekeeping are at least as important as its cultural or historical significance Some say that harbor class of and are uncomfortable with the idea that history can have a price In a lot of anti or museum that goes on there is always a background of quasi socialist sentiment said a lawyer at Bell in New York who art You always hear hissing about money That collision of was on vivid display on March in a conference room in where the committee a public hearing The issue was an extension of import on from and Mali Speaking in favor was an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University who carried out of Maya there With barely restrained disgust he told the panel that a single serpentine figure might bring at s auction house from its context in a Maya tomb however its testimony to how the Maya the civilization would be lost he said Later in the hearing the nonprofit group Saving for Everyone expressed dismay at the high ancient statuary from Mali brought at auction That pointed from a dealer in art who is one of the on the committee Do you think it is a good or a bad thing that these are worth the millions that you say they are he If there were no international market and these wealthy people willing to spend this money on these what would happen to them If those had little to no value do you think they would survive Under the current law a foreign nation must meet certain criteria to obtain It must document the extent to which important cultural and It must provide evidence that it is inside its It must establish that the market in these is large enough to warrant more control and that other to address are not available And the law that in most import should be only if other are imposing similar so that and are not unfairly The committee whether these criteria have been met and a recommendation to the State Department which the final decision The department almost never to follow the recommendation By law the committee of unpaid by the president three each from the art trade and three who represent the public and two who represent the of But this system gone awry according to former committee and familiar with the committee s While nominally balanced they say in practice a number of the museum and public on the panel have been drawn from the archaeological camp For instance the most recent museum on the panel both came from the Field Museum in Unlike many other top in the United the Field archaeological digs and no longer on the art market about the balance on the committee the State Department that question to the White House a policy of not on personnel a White House spokeswoman declined to explain how the president The committee s also say State Department have used conflict of interest to nudge the committee toward import the noted New York dealer in art declined a seat on the panel in after State Department told him he would not be able to discuss or vote on any petition from a country in whose art he I was after a long process of investigation he said and then they said Oh well you cannot speak about any art This made less than no sense This is a perversion of the intent of the law on the other hand have not been to recuse themselves from or where they have taken part in Yet protest that these are also of interest since must rely on the good favor of these foreign to receive continued permission to dig The committee also been for its secrecy The State Department almost all material to the group to aid its press and information available on the It also the original for import that foreign submit as well as the that the committee to the department Committee are also told they cannot independently investigate the related to a country s petition or discuss the matter with outside apart from those who appear at the committee s infrequent Patty who is chairman of the Archaeological Institute of s cultural property legislation committee and as a public representative on the committee from to said she saw good reason for the secrecy She said that as a committee member she might have felt from speaking candidly in if she thought her might later become public She also said information to the committee might if become a road map for interested in But the committee s current chairman Jay a real estate magnate and collector of at the secrecy under which the State Department the panel work In my opinion the and lack of transparency under which we are to operate in our at C P A C are to say the least unusual and in many they are unbearable immoral and maybe either extra legal or in contradiction of the law he said C Miller Crouch deputy assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural said that the law that the committee explicitly it from public disclosure that apply to similar federal advisory Given the secrecy surrounding the panel s it is difficult to predict how the State Department will rule on China s request What is certain is that the controversy over the committee is not going away With on the rise according to the number of import is only likely to grow and the clash between and will continue list list list te te bin mailman list End of list Digest

1,Re: [R] Generate a serie of new vars that correlate withexistingvar,Reading your and thinking this over my current impression is that this could make a good page or other tutorial Yes there are probably more people out there who would like to do this but have not had the theory class to learn the of how this method works But rather than give a function that the I would rather spell out the method with some explanation for them to follow along with what need to be done along the way For example this method only works if the desired correlation matrix is positive definite one way to check this is that all the are positive or a modification of this method can still work if it is positive semi definite For the example that this thread it worked out that for the non worked but if the had been enough higher then would not have worked can you imagine a case where is highly positively correlated with and but and are independent of each other A tutorial page can explain the test to do and what to do if it a function would tend to hide this important detail and send target to the list with about cryptic error I am happy to work on a tutorial page and currently the a logical place to put it I however have never before is that the proper verb is there anyone out there who would be willing to help with that side of Or propose a better alternative L Snow D Statistical Data Center Intermountain snow Original Message From Sent AM To Snow r help math Subject Re R Generate a of new that correlate Hello and List for your reply and and sorry for my Of course you re right and I agree a with all your Probably my suggestion was first of all a mark of appreciation for your solution Here is the path I to get where I was but I see that I was probably misunderstanding what the core of R The question of making such related of is nearly a as you point out in your reply It to me that it is often by or with relatively small statistical knowledge To get to your solution a good understanding is of what correlation is as well as of matrix and My guess was that the people listed above have generally not I from my own experience that the core of R was either to or to rather complicated to handle or produce as simple or classical From my same own experience I was not able to imagine to which non core package such a function should obviously be added I that in the same manner a person seeking for the function could have some in it Until now I did not have a look to your package I do it but I know of other of often not who have a need to generate such data and would not think of getting there to find a way To end with all this mainly that I did not understand R philosophy as well as I thought Thanks and Snow a I have thought of something like this to a package but here is my current thinking on the issue This question or similar been a few times so there is some demand for a general answer I see three Have an example of the necessary in a publicly available place Write a function and include it in a non core package Add it to the core of R or a core package Number is already in process as the e will be part of the archive Though someone is welcome to add it to the if they think that would be useful as well Your suggestion is number but I would argue that is better than for the simple reason that anything added to the core is to be top quality and have pretty much any that most people would think of it in a non core package it available with less of quality The question then becomes what do we make available Do we have them specify the entire correlation structure Or just assume the new will be independent of each other What should the function do if the set of result in a matrix that is not positive definite What if the user to have fixed And other My current thinking is that the process is simple enough that it is easier to do this by hand than to remember all the to the function There are currently people who use bootstrap and permutation without loading in the that do these because it is to write the code by hand than to remember the syntax of the I think this type of data generation under the same situation But if you or someone else that there is enough justification for a function to do this and can specify what it should have I will be happy to add it to my package this an appropriate place since one of the that I want to generate data with a specific correlation structure is when an example for Hope this Assistant Ecole Mines d P F PAU direct R help math list mailman r help PLEASE do read the posting guide R project posting guide and provide minimal self reproducible code

1,Re: [R] Reasons to Use R,is a big issue in The way I prefer it is an easy license a license which it possible that I can work on another without paying a lot of money R quite good and is widely used That it a statistical package that I want The other thing is that working with large some effort by to get it working I doubt if R the capability of working consistently with large That is an issue I think I have done some between and R and R to be so I can do with it Nonetheless the data handling is not quite as good I think in comparison with When I doing statistics there were about three and at least these were available On a you were to use Nowadays there are some with excellent or you can compute the statistical or an exotic one I haven t got a clue how to work with new was my only education and everything So I cannot answer if R is capable of working with large in relation to I really don t know The only thing I know that if I compute a it works on a relatively large not Fisher by the way The same with a likelihood procedure or non or factor analysis But are an issue I been told by a guy who works with R was a better option he told me So what s the big deal about S instead of memory like R I don t get the point t there enough swap space for S Who anyway it works t it Or are there any with S and large I don t get it You use them So you might discuss that issue The keep some have in the past but don t now some you can get an additional for home at a price Some it on the type of you have at work currently our is such that the people in my group can all have it but at most can be it at any time how does that affect it at home I may be able to install some of the at home also but for most of them I have given up trying to figure out the legality of it and so I have not them at home to be on the safe side Some of the I work with who are also with the local university have that they can get a academic version of and could use that but my interpretation of the academic that one me probably not the most recent said in my interpretation I am not a lawyer that if they the without paying a upgrade fee they would be the the academic version was intended for teaching only The R on the other hand is pretty clear that I can install it and use it pretty much anywhere I want You are right in correcting me R is not the only package that can be used on multiple

already received You that price is not at issue but there are other than money that you may want to look at On my work machine I have R S PLUS and a couple of other on my and home I have R So if a deadline is looming and I am working on a project mainly in R it is easy to work on it on the bus or at home or in a boring meeting the same does not work for a or project thinking about this now maybe I need to do less in R R and S PLUS are very flexible if you have a certain plot that you make often you can write your own function script to do it automatically most other will give you their standard then you have to modify it to meet your With and the and you can whole very useful for that you do month after month And what I think is the biggest advantage of R and S PLUS is that they strongly encourage you to think about your data Other at least that I am familiar with tend to have specific way of treating your data and expect you to modify your data to fit that model These can be force you to your data to fit their model or allow that should really be separate data to be combined into a single and sometimes both S on the other hand many different ways to store and work with your data and as you analyze the data different of new analysis open up depending on early rather than just getting stock output for a procedure If all you want is a black box where data goes in one
